# 🔍 Grover's Algorithm in Qiskit

This repository contains a **Qiskit implementation of Grover's search algorithm**.  
The code builds a quantum circuit to find a marked item in a 5-qubit database using Grover’s oracle and diffusion operator.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 Implements **Grover's algorithm** for 5 qubits.  
- ⚡ Uses **controlled gates and CCX gates** to define the oracle.  
- 📏 Includes **diffusion operator** to amplify the correct state.  
- 📊 Measures all qubits and visualizes results with a **histogram**.
